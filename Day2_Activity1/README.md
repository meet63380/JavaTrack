2. Write a Java program to Implement this task.
 
 Create a class HotelRoom 
Include the following private data members / attributes:
hotelName – of type String
numberOfSqFeet – of type Integer
hasTV - of type Boolean
hasWifi – of type Boolean
 
Include the following public methods :
 Create a constructor that initializes all the data members
public HotelRoom(String hotelName,Integer numberOfSqFeet,Boolean hasTV,Boolean hasWifi)
"calculateTariff" – Calculates cost using the number of sq feets and cost per sq feet and returns an Integer.
"getRatePerSqFeet" - This method returns an Integer. In this case, it always returns 0
 
 Create a class DeluxeRoom that extends HotelRoom
 Include the following protected attributes / data members:
 ratePerSqFeet – of type Integer.
Include the following public methods :
Include a constructor that sets ratePerSqFeet as 10.
public HotelRoom(String hotelName,Integer numberOfSqFeet,Boolean hasTV,Boolean hasWifi)
 "getRatePerSqFeet" – returns (ratePerSqFeet + 2) if wifi is present, else returns ratePerSqFeet.
 
Create a class DeluxeSeaViewRoom that extends DeluxeRoom
Include the following public methods :
Include a constructor that sets ratePerSqFeet as 12.
 
Create a class SuiteRoom that extends HotelRoom
 Include the following private attributes / data members:
ratePerSqFeet – of type Integer. 
Include the following public methods :
Include a constructor that sets ratePerSqFeet as 15.
public HotelRoom(String hotelName,Integer numberOfSqFeet,Boolean hasTV,Boolean hasWifi)
getRatePerSqFeet – returns (ratePerSqFeet + 2) if wifi is present, else returns ratePerSqFeet.
 
Create a Main class to test the above classes.
 
Sample Input Output 1:
Hotel Tariff Calculator
1. Deluxe Room
2. Deluxe AC Room
3. Suite AC Room
Select Room Type:
1
Hotel Name:
Taj
Room Square Feet Area:

3.	Create abstract class as “Match”.
Add the following private members.
Data type	Field name
Int	currentscore
Float	currentover
Int	target

Use getter and setter methods.

Create another class ODIMatch that extends the Match. (50 overs)

Create another class TestMatch that extends the Match. Consider test match is in the last day. (90 Overs)

Create another class T20Match that extends the Match. (20 Overs)

Create the following abstract methods in the Match Class. Implement it in other respective class.
1.	float calculateRunRate()
2.	int calculateBalls()
3.	void display(double reqRunrate, int balls)

Create the MatchMain class and the inherited class using main method. Calculate the required runrate and number of balls for each derived class.
